## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/lightning-hire-support.git
   cd lightning-hire-support
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file based on the provided example:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

4. Edit the `.env.local` file and fill in the required values:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: Connection string to your MongoDB database
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The base URL of your support portal
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A secure random string for NextAuth.js
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Database Setup

The support portal shares the same MongoDB database as the main LightningHire application. It creates the following collections:

- `knowledgearticles`
- `articlecategories`
- `chatconversations`
- `chatmessages`

For the RAG-powered chatbot, you need to set up a MongoDB vector search index:

```bash
# Start the server, then access:
GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/setup/vector-index
```

## Initial Content Setup

1. Log in with an admin account from the main LightningHire application
2. Navigate to the admin dashboard at `/admin`
3. Create categories and knowledge base articles

## Deployment

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy to Vercel or another hosting platform:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. Ensure all environment variables are set in your production environment
